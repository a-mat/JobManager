# jobmanager
 
This script allows you to clean up any remaining jobs in your directory that are done.It searches for the keyword "DONE" in the directory and marks them for deletion.

The goal of this script is to allow you to delete DONE jobs and can be filtered down at a User Level and App Level. A automatic "refresh" rate will also be worked
on so that this script can be kept running to delete JOBS as they come in.



FUTURE GOAL:
delete jobs by certain saved search names, by how long they have been done for
